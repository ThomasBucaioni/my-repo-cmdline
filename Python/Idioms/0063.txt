Make sense: to be able to reason something out. The presentation did not make sense at all. It was way off the topic
Building blocks: something that is a basic element (of the subject). The building blocks of success, in my view, come from perseverance and hard work
Brought forward: to bring forth. The meeting has been brought forward by the board and we have to start preparing for it right away
Kill time: to wait for something by doing something or nothing. The team was killing time at the stadium before it was their turn to play
Surgical strike: to cause injury or damage to the intended targets. The surgical strikes that the indian army carried out in the year 2016 were an example of the strength that they hold. The enemy better not mess around here
Take breath away: astonish; surprise; amaze or astound somebody. The ring literally took my breath away. There was a monster of a diamond on it
Made it: used to indicated the completion of a task. "it is so amazing that you made it because we heard that it was a very difficult task."
You bet: for sure. The manager will pull this deal off. You bet on something else about him because this is definitely happening
Come what may: anything happens; whatever come about. The girl has decided to marry him come what may. She will proceed even if her entire family is against her decision
You’ve got to be kidding: implies that something that someone said is a joke. Dan said. "i got a job as an associate professor in the university! wow!" tina replied. "you've got to be kidding!"
