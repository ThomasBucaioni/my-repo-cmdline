Pour oil on troubled waters: try to calm, soothe or placate a problematic situation. She's such a calm person; last week, the whole office was in uproar until she stepped in and poured oil on troubled waters
Elephant in the room: a difficult, controversial, or obvious problem that no one wants to talk about or mention because the subject is problematic, uncomfortable, or awkward. When geoff arrived at the meeting yesterday, he had a huge black eye. He gave us no explanation, and nobody dared ask him about it. So we sat there for the whole morning with this elephant in the room
Barking dogs seldom bite: to threaten someone, but not take action or follow through with threats. "i haven't finished my maths homework. You know what mr peterson is like, he'll shout so loud they will hear him in the next town.""yes, but barking dogs seldom bite. It's just his way."
Nail in the coffin: an action/event that will help bring about the death, end, or failure of something or someone. She was late for the fourth day in a row. It will be another nail in her coffin when the boss hears about it

More than meets the eye: not as simple as it looks. I had done some research, but there's more to the subject than meets the eye
In the red: more money going out than coming in. If your bank account goes in the red, the bank will charge you for every transaction
White elephant: an expensive item with no use or purpose. Everyone thought the olympic stadiums would be a white elephant after the closing ceremony
In hand: under control. Don't worry about a thing; i've got it all in hand. I did it all online
Straight shooter: someone who speaks the truth. I really like ken. He's a straight shooter, that's for sure
