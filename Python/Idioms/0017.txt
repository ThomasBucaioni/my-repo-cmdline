On the horizon: an event that is most likely going to happen soon. I have seen the way your boss praises your work. I am sure that a promotion is on the horizon
Wild goose chase: wasting resource working on something that does not exist. They tampered with my research. Thank god i found it out. I'm sure they were hoping to send me on a wild goose chase as i continue my research
Kick the can down the road: to avoid dealing with a problem. I realise that the house needs to be painted but we are going to move in a few years so i am kicking the can down the road
Pat on the back
Heart touching: an event that makes you feel happy. We watched a heart-touching movie about a boy who lived next to a concentration camp during the second world war
Tick off
Mull over
Right away: to do something immediately. I promise to complete my homework right away
Turn out: to arrive at an event. They had fewer people turn out for their party than they anticipated
For a while
