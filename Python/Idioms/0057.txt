Strive to do: to try very hard to achieve. This is perhaps the only politician that i have come across who strives to do what he promised
None of your lip: to ask someone to stop speaking. You have broken the window panes while the mother is not home now. I want none of your lip, and you will help me clean this out before she is back
Take effect
Time and again
Back to the wall: to be in a difficult situation. They have him with his back to the wall and now he has no more options but to pay back the debtors or go to jail for fraud
Within earshot
Concern with
Comb through: to check thoroughly. The police combed through their house after the income tax authorities left the building
Chill to the bone: to get frightened or scare somebody. The movie they played on cable last night gave me a chill to the bone. I will not be watching a night time movie any time soon
Keep on top
