At odds
Under siege
Have no business﻿
Take heart﻿: to stay confident and positive. We lost the elections - it is a part of the game. But we absolutely take heart in the apparently greater awareness and involvement of the young generation in keeping the spirit of democracy
Rake over the coals
Stand in a good stead: to be of advantage to someone. His years of experience in the spoken english field has stood him in good stead
Smack dab: exactly. We got our water balloons fully filled and threw smack dab at their heads. It was fun, i tell you!
Get a life
Throw under the bus: to betray a partner, colleague or close friend for self-benefits. Mark always looks for someone to blame and throw under the bus for his failings
Cold sweat
