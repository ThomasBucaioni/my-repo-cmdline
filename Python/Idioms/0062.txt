Rat race: to be following a routine that is both, exhaustive as well as competitive. The man has been in a rat race all his life. No wonder he is enjoying his retired life to the fullest
Upper hand: to have the authority to make decisions over someone or something. The man has an upper hand to his wife. It is reflected in the way he speaks with her
Stop by: to meet someone or go somewhere in a brief and informal manner. The gardener stopped by the nursery to get some soil for his garden
Must have: to be done in a compulsory manner. The must haves this season include a tunic and a head scarf
Come across: to meet someone. The men had never come across a failure and hence did not know how to deal with it
Way around: to find an alternative for something, someone or to perform a task. The way around such a problem would mean that we lose another 6 months in the completion of this project
Just in case: to do something as a precautionary measure. The cake was ordered just in case the desert that she made did not turn up well
Race against time: effort to do something as soon as possible. The completion of this project was honestly a race against time. The client needed to have filed the documents in the court by today at any cost
Bakerâ€™s dozen: not 12 in numbers but 13. The fellow gave me a baker's dozen of cookies. It made my children very happy
In the pipeline: to be underway. The project has been in the pipeline since forever. I am not sure if it will ever get completed
