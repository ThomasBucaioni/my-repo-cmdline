Stand your ground: not retreat. We stood our ground on the footpath, and then eventually, all the cows moved away
Outside the lines: not sticking to the rules. I never thought they would be allowed to do their duties outside the lines
Halfway house: mid-point in recovery, treatment, or progress. Frank has gone into a halfway house after 27 years in prison
Not believe eyes: shock or surprise at something you see or hear. My fiancé is with someone else - i can't believe my eyes
Spick and span: neat and clean. The house was spick and span when the guests arrived. Jane must have been cleaning for hours
Come to think of/about it: something that has just occurred to us as we speak. Come to think of it, add potatoes and carrots to the list
Worm in the apple: the presence of something very bad in the best. There's nothing worse than getting a worm in your apple!
Without further ado: no fuss or ceremony. Steve is very organised and friendly. When we met him last week, he introduced us all to the team without further ado
Dutch uncle: criticize, scold or lecture someone. I thought he would approve of my choices, but he ranted on like a dutch uncle for a whole hour
King of the hill: be the undisputed champion. He made £3 million before he was 30, so he is the king of the hill in this industry
